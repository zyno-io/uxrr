Copyright (c) 2026 Signal24 LLC dba Zyno Consulting. All rights reserved.

## 1. Definitions

**“Licensed Work”** means the uxrr source code, documentation, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing.

**“Licensor”** means Signal24 LLC dba Zyno Consulting.

**“You”** means the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.

**“Affiliate”** means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an entity, where “control” means ownership of more than 50% of the voting interests (or equivalent).

**“Organization”** means, as applicable, You and Your Affiliates.

**“Third Party”** means any person or entity other than You and Your Organization. For avoidance of doubt, customers, end users, clients, partners, and the general public are Third Parties.

**“Internal Use”** means use, running, modification, and deployment of the Licensed Work solely within Your Organization for Your internal business operations.

Internal Use includes operation of the Licensed Work by Your employees and contractors acting solely on Your behalf, provided they are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as protective as Yours. Internal Use also includes operation by a third-party service provider solely to support Your internal business operations, provided that (i) such service provider is not granted rights to use the Licensed Work for any other purpose, and (ii) such use does not provide access to the Licensed Work’s functionality to any Third Party.

**“Commercial Product”** means any product or service (including on-prem software, appliances, or hosted offerings) that You make available to a Third Party for a fee or other commercial consideration.

**“Hosted Service”** means providing access to the functionality of the Licensed Work to Third Parties over a network (including SaaS, hosted/managed service, API access, multi-tenant service, or similar models), whether branded as Your own or otherwise.

**“Distribute”** means to provide, deliver, transfer, make available, or otherwise furnish the Licensed Work (or any portion of it), in source or binary form, to any Third Party.

## 2. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and restrictions of this License, the Licensor grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to:

1. view, copy, and modify the Licensed Work; and
2. run and deploy the Licensed Work,
   **solely for Internal Use**.

You may integrate the Licensed Work with Your internal systems and software for Internal Use.

## 3. Restrictions

Without a separate commercial license from the Licensor, You may NOT:

(a) **Provide a Hosted Service.** Use the Licensed Work to provide a Hosted Service to any Third Party.

(b) **Embed or bundle into a Commercial Product.** Embed, incorporate, bundle, or include the Licensed Work (in whole or in part) into any Commercial Product, or otherwise use it as a dependency or component of a Commercial Product that is provided to a Third Party.

(c) **Distribute or sublicense.** Distribute, sublicense, sell, lease, assign, or otherwise make the Licensed Work (or any portion of it), in source or binary form, available to any Third Party.

(d) **White-label or rebrand.** Remove, obscure, or alter any licensing, copyright, branding, or attribution notices in a way that represents the Licensed Work as a Third Party’s product, or market a product primarily derived from the Licensed Work as Your own offering to Third Parties.

(e) **Circumvent restrictions.** Circumvent or attempt to circumvent the restrictions in this License, including by separating components, proxying, or providing “access” to Licensed Work functionality to Third Parties by any technical or contractual arrangement intended to avoid the Hosted Service or Distribution restrictions.

## 4. Outputs and Results

You may provide to Third Parties **outputs** generated by the Licensed Work during Internal Use (including reports, exports, screenshots, logs, traces, analytics, session replays, clips, summaries, or other results), provided that You do not thereby:

(i) Distribute the Licensed Work;
(ii) provide a Hosted Service; or
(iii) grant Third Parties access to the functionality of the Licensed Work.

For clarity, sharing outputs with Third Parties is permitted, including in connection with support, incident response, customer communications, or compliance, provided it does not grant Third Parties access to the functionality of the Licensed Work.

Providing outputs “on demand” to Third Parties in a manner that effectively exposes the Licensed Work’s functionality (including via API or automated request/response workflows) may constitute a Hosted Service.

## 5. Permitted and Prohibited Examples (Non-Exhaustive)

Permitted without a commercial license:

- A company self-hosting uxrr internally to debug and improve its website/app, even if the company’s business serves customers.
- Using uxrr internally to operate, monitor, or improve a revenue-generating product or service, so long as Third Parties are not granted access to uxrr itself.
- Sharing a replay clip or incident report with a customer to explain an issue, so long as the customer is not granted access to uxrr itself.
- Using contractors or a service provider to operate uxrr solely for Your Internal Use under confidentiality obligations.

Prohibited without a commercial license:

- Providing customers or other Third Parties with direct access to uxrr (including temporary access, guest accounts, shared logins, VPN access, or screen-sharing intended to provide interactive access to uxrr itself).
- Offering uxrr (or substantially similar functionality) to Third Parties as a hosted/managed service or API.
- Shipping a desktop/on-prem product that bundles uxrr as a component or dependency, or otherwise embedding uxrr into a Commercial Product provided to Third Parties.

## 6. Commercial Licensing

## 13. Termination

Any use of the Licensed Work in violation of this License automatically and immediately terminates Your rights under this License.

If the Licensor provides You written notice of a non-willful breach, Your rights will terminate only if You fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. This cure period does not apply to breaches involving Hosted Service, Distribution, embedding/bundling into a Commercial Product, or white-labeling.

The parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in Florida for any dispute arising out of or relating to this License or the Licensed Work.
